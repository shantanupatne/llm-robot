# A Desktop Companion Bot configured with VLMs.

The aim of this project is to create a small robot that can navigate around a desk or a room and act as a companion. The robot is equiped with camera, microphone, and ultrasonic sensors that are interfaced with onmidirectional (mecanum) wheels through a RaspberryPi.

The robot can listen to commands, view its surroundings and navigate as required. For the purpose of this project, an Android phone is used as the camera and microphone.
